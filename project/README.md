## Questions from Haoji

* how often should resolve_conflicts endpoint be hit?
* if no new block mined locally, isn't we are having an infinitely growing current_transactions list?
* using decimal vs float?


## Haoji's version on how it can work in terms of baby food transaction:
* wtf???


## Dev guide
* `docker-compose build app`
* `docker-compose up -d app`
* go to 'localhost:5000/mine' to mine a new block
